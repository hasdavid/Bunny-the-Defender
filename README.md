# Bunny the Defender

One of my first Python programs, a simple game written in Python 3. The player takes the role of a warrior bunny, who has to defend his castle against a horde of badgers. The goal of the project was to play with and explore Python, its module PyGame and object-oriented programming.

## Running the game

Download the repository, start a command line and navigate to the main folder. Launch as a script
`./game.py` or using the Python interpreter `python3 ./game.py`.

## Controls

The bunny moves with keys `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` and turns by following the mouse cursor. After a click he shoots an arrow.

## Possible future updates

I might refactor the code using the PyGame's module _Sprite_. I also plan to remove the _point_ library dependency, since it did not provide much useful functionality and instead just made the code messier.

## Credit

The graphics and music in the game come from [this guy](https://www.raywenderlich.com/2795-beginning-game-programming-for-teens-with-python).

I did not come up with the concept. I just recreated the game using object-oriented paradigm and rewrote the code as I thought would be better. All the credit still goes to the original author.
