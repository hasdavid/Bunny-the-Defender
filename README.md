# Bunny the Defender

One of my first Python programs, a simple game written in Python 3. The player takes the role of a warrior bunny, who has to defend his castle against a horde of badgers. The goal of the project was to play with and explore Python, PyGame and object-oriented programming.

## Running the game

Download the repo, go to the main folder in command line and launch as a script:
`./game.py`
...or using the Python interpreter:
`python3 ./game.py`

## Controls

The bunny moves with keys 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' and turns by following the mouse cursor. After a click he shoots an arrow.

## Credit

The graphics and music in game come from [this guy](https://www.raywenderlich.com/2795-beginning-game-programming-for-teens-with-python).

I did not come up with the concept. I just recreated the game using object-oriented paradigm and rewrote the code as I thought would be better. All the credit still goes to the original author.
